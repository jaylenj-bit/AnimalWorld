          <h2>About the Animal</h2>
          <ul>
           <li> Scientific Name: Vulpes vulpes</li>
           <li> Family: Canidae (the dog family)</li>
           <li>Order: Carnivora</li>
           <li>Lifespan: 2 to 5 years in the wild; up to 14 years in captivity</li>
           <li> Habitat: Forests, grasslands, mountains, deserts, and urban areas</li>
            <li>Conservation Status: Least Concern (IUCN)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) belongs to the Canidae family, which includes dogs, wolves, and other fox species. It is one of the most adaptable and widespread carnivores in the world. Most red foxes have reddish-orange fur, with a white underbelly and chest, black legs, black-tipped ears, and a signature bushy tail—called a "brush"—that ends in a white tip. Adults typically range from 45 to 90 centimeters (18 to 35 inches) in body length, with tails measuring 30 to 55 centimeters (12 to 22 inches), and they weigh between 3.6 and 6.8 kilograms (8 to 15 pounds). </p>
            <br>
            <p>Red foxes are generally solitary animals and are most active at night or during twilight hours. They communicate through various vocalizations, body language, and scent markings. During winter, they enter the mating season, and after a gestation period of around 51 to 53 days, a female (vixen) gives birth to a litter of 4 to 6 kits in early spring. The kits are born blind and rely heavily on their parents, becoming more independent as they grow throughout the summer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Red foxes are known for their intelligence and have long been portrayed in folklore as clever tricksters. They’ve adapted incredibly well to city life, often making use of green spaces and human resources to survive. In colder regions, their thick fur helps them withstand low temperatures, and they possess excellent hearing that allows them to detect prey underground.</p>

          <h2>Diet</h2>
           <p>Omnivorous by nature, red foxes eat a diverse diet that includes small mammals like mice and rabbits, birds, insects, fruits, and berries. In urban environments, they often scavenge human food waste and pet food. Their feeding habits change with the seasons based on what's available.</p>
