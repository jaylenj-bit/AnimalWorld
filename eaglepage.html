          <h2>About the Animal</h2>
          <p>Eagles are large birds of prey belonging to the Accipitridae family, which also includes hawks, kites, and vultures. Known for their strength, keen eyesight, and powerful flight, eagles are apex predators found on nearly every continent, with over 60 species worldwide. The most well-known species include the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), native to North America, and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), found across the Northern Hemisphere. Eagles typically live 20 to 30 years in the wild, though some have lived longer in captivity.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Most eagles are monogamous and often mate for life. During breeding season, a pair will build a large nest called an aerie, usually high in trees or on cliffs. These nests can be reused and added to each year, sometimes becoming massive in size. After mating, the female lays 1 to 3 eggs, and both parents take part in raising the eaglets, which fledge after about 10 to 12 weeks but may remain dependent on their parents for several more weeks.</p>

          <h2>Habitat</h2>
          <p>Eagles inhabit a wide variety of environments, including mountains, forests, grasslands, deserts, and coastal regions. Many prefer areas near large bodies of water, especially species like the bald eagle, which relies heavily on fish as a food source. Other species, such as the golden eagle, hunt mammals like rabbits, squirrels, and even foxes in open or rocky terrain.</p>

          <h2>Diet</h2>
          <p>Carnivorous by nature, eagles are opportunistic hunters and scavengers. They mainly feed on fish, birds, and small to medium-sized mammals. Some species also steal food from other animals or scavenge carrion. Their powerful grip—one of the strongest in the bird world—helps them capture prey mid-flight or pin it down from a perch.</p>
