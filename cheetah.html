          <h2>About the Animal</h2>
          <p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is currently listed as Vulnerable, with some subspecies such as the Asiatic cheetah being Critically Endangered. The global population is estimated at fewer than 7,000 individuals, and it continues to decline due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and illegal pet trade. Because cheetahs require large territories to hunt effectively, the fragmentation of their habitats has made it harder for them to survive. Additionally, their genetic diversity is extremely low, making them more susceptible to disease and reducing reproductive success. Conservation efforts include expanding protected areas, educating local communities, and implementing relocation and captive breeding programs.</p>

          <h2>Habitat</h2>
          <p>Cheetahs primarily inhabit the open grasslands, savannas, and lightly wooded areas of sub-Saharan Africa, though a small population of Asiatic cheetahs remains in Iran. These animals prefer environments with tall grass and low vegetation, which they use for cover when stalking prey. However, agricultural development, expanding human populations, and infrastructure projects have encroached on cheetah territories. As a result, many cheetahs now live outside protected areas, which increases their vulnerability to poaching and retaliation killings by farmers.</p>

          <h2>Diet</h2>
          <p>Cheetahs are obligate carnivores and are specially adapted to hunt small to medium-sized ungulates. Their primary diet includes species like gazelles, impalas, and young wildebeests. Unlike other big cats, cheetahs rely on speed rather than strength or stealth aloneâ€”they can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just a few seconds. However, after a high-speed chase, they require rest before eating, leaving them vulnerable to scavengers like hyenas and lions. Cheetahs typically hunt during the day to avoid competition with nocturnal predators.</p>
